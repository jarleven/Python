# ESP8266 MicroPython Quickstart

Bits and pieces for running MicroPython on a LoLin ESP8266 (NodeMcu V3)
These experiments where done on Ubuntu 18.10 AMD64. 

This document is only intended as a quickstart for owners of a LoLin NodeMcu V3. A few examples to get started.

For details go to the official Micropython documentation  https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/quickref.html


### Load MicroPython to the MCU

A few tools.
The tools you need can be installed with the Python pip package manager.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)

To upload the MicroPython enviromnet to the MCU use the esptool. In the commands below the device came up as /dev/ttyUSB0.
To load files to the system after installing Micropython to the target you can use the ampy tool from Adafruit.

Install the tools as below and download the MircroPython binary from here : http://micropython.org/download#esp8266
For this experiment i used "esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin"
More information on the official pages : https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html

```
sudo adduser $USER dialout
sudo apt install python-pip
pip install esptool adafruit-ampy

wget http://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin

esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect 0 esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin



ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put boot.py 
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put main.py 

ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 get boot.py 
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 get main.py 


```

### Nice to know
```
Ctrl+D   - Do a soft reboot of the MCU

http://micropython.org/webrepl/
import webrepl_setup

minicom --device /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200
```
The ampy tool can run, put, get, delete files. Read on at Adafruit to learn more.

### Default files in the filesystem
```
boot.py - First file to load
main.py - Loads after boot.py have been executed
```

### The LoLin NodeMcu V3 module
![NodeMCU V3](https://i1.wp.com/www.teachmemicro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/NodeMCUv3.0-pinout.jpg?resize=768%2C507&ssl=1)

The ESP-12 module onboard LED is on GPIO2  (Note active low LED)

### Blink LED

```Python
# Blink the internal LoLin LED
from machine import Pin
from time import sleep

# GPIO2 (D4) is the internal LED for the ESP-12 module
# This LED is active low
led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)

while True:
    led.on()
    sleep(1)
    led.off()
    sleep(1)


# Small modification of code from https://github.com/lvidarte/esp8266/wiki/MicroPython:-LED
```


Save this as blink.py then run the file with the ampy tool.
```
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 run blink.py
```

Upload the file to the target filesystem
```
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put blink.py 
```

### Read pushbutton value
```Python
# Set internal LED with the FLASH pushbutton
from machine import Pin

# GPIO2 (D4) is the internal LED for the ESP-12 module, This LED is active low
# GPIO0 (D3) is the FLASH pushbutton on the LoLin module, push/active low
# 

led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
button = Pin(0, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)


while True:
    if not button.value():  # Active low when button is pushed
        led.off()           # Light up the LED
    else:
        led.on()            # No light
```

### Interrupt callback - toggle LED
```Python
# Set internal LED with the FLASH pushbutton. Interrupt controlled
from machine import Pin

# GPIO2 (D4) is the internal LED for the ESP-12 module, This LED is active low
# GPIO0 (D3) is the FLASH pushbutton on the LoLin module, push/active low
# 

led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
button = Pin(0, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)

LEDState = False

def callback(p):
    global LEDState               # To modify a global variable we need to state it's name
    LEDState = not LEDState
    #print('pin change', p)

button.irq(trigger=Pin.IRQ_FALLING, handler=callback)


while True:
  
    if LEDState:     # Represents the pushbutton state
        led.off()    # Light up the LED
    else:
        led.on()     # No light
```

### Debounce
```Python
# ESP8266 Pushbutton debounce, interrupdriven and timer debounced

# Timer example from https://www.dfrobot.com/blog-606.html
# Quote Mar 17, 2018 "p.irq(trigger=0,handler=callback) seems to properly disable the interruptions."
# https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/2847

# GPIO2 (D4) is the internal LED for the ESP-12 module, This LED is active low
# GPIO0 (D3) is the FLASH pushbutton on the LoLin module, push/active low


from machine import Pin
from machine import Timer

KeyPushed = False
DEBOUNCE_TIME = 100

button = Pin(0, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)

debounceTimer = Timer(-1)

#
# For the ESP8266 there is some chaos regarding the pin interrupt handling, see link above
#
def enable_btirq():
    button.irq(trigger=Pin.IRQ_FALLING, handler=isr_callback)

def disable_btirq():
    button.irq(trigger=0, handler=isr_callback)


#
# Interrupt handler
#
def isr_callback(p):
    global KeyPushed
    KeyPushed = True
    disable_btirq()
  

#
# Debounce the pin and wait for the button to be released before we enable the interrupt again.
#
def timer_callback(t):
    # Register interrup pin
    if not button.value():
        debounceTimer.init(period=DEBOUNCE_TIME, mode=Timer.ONE_SHOT, callback=timer_callback)
        print("Button not released")
    else:
        enable_btirq()
        print("Waiting for your keypress")


print("Starting, waiting for user input")
enable_btirq()
counter = 0

while True:
     
    if KeyPushed:
        # The event will be processed, clear the flag
        KeyPushed = False
        
        # Debounce
	debounceTimer.init(period=DEBOUNCE_TIME, mode=Timer.ONE_SHOT, callback=timer_callback)

	counter = counter + 1
	print("Button have been pressed %s times" % counter)
```


### Connect to WLAN
```Python
import network
sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
sta_if.active(True)
sta_if.connect('<your ESSID>', '<your password>')

# Show the IP of the module
sta_if.ifconfig()

From : https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/network_basics.html
```

### Send data over a network socket
```Python
# Send data over a TCP socket

import socket

HOST, PORT = "192.168.1.104", 54130
DATA = "binary LED8 on"

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

sock.connect((HOST, PORT))
sock.sendall(DATA + "\n\n")
received = sock.recv(1024)

sock.close()
```

### Put it all together
```Python
# Send data over a network socket when pushbutton is pressed and set the LED

from machine import Pin
import socket

# GPIO2 (D4) is the internal LED for the ESP-12 module, This LED is active low
# GPIO0 (D3) is the FLASH pushbutton on the LoLin module, push/active low
# 

HOST, PORT = "192.168.1.104", 54130

led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
button = Pin(0, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)

LEDState = False
SendState = False

# Function callback on falling edge pin interrupt
def callback(p):
    global SendState          # To modify a global variable we need to state it's name
    SendState = True
    print('pin change', p)

# Register the interrupt
button.irq(trigger=Pin.IRQ_FALLING, handler=callback)


# "Main loop"
while True:

    # Do we have a new interrupt ?
    if SendState:
        SendState = False

        if LEDState:     # Represents the pushbutton state
            led.off()    # Light up the LED
	    netValue = "on"
        else:
            led.on()     # No light
	    netValue = "off"

	netData = "binary LED8 %s" % (netValue)
        print(netData)

        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.connect((HOST, PORT))
        sock.sendall(netData + "\n\n")
        received = sock.recv(1024)
        sock.close()
        print("Got data echo: ")
        print(received)

        # Toggle the LED state
        LEDState = not LEDState
```

### Put it all together and add debounce to the button
This example will be cleaned up a bit.
```Python
# Set internal LED with the FLASH pushbutton. Interrupt controlled
from machine import Pin
from machine import Timer
import socket


# GPIO2 (D4) is the internal LED for the ESP-12 module, This LED is active low
# GPIO0 (D3) is the FLASH pushbutton on the LoLin module, push/active low
# 


HOST, PORT = "192.168.1.104", 54130

led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
led.on() # The onboard LED is active low so just turn it off for now.
button = Pin(0, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)

tim = Timer(-1)


LEDState = False
SendState = False

# For the ESP8266 there is some chaos regarding the pin interrupt handling
# Quote Mar 17, 2018 "p.irq(trigger=0,handler=callback) seems to properly disable the interruptions."
# https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/2847
def enable_btirq():
    button.irq(trigger=Pin.IRQ_FALLING, handler=isr_callback)

def disable_btirq():
    button.irq(trigger=0, handler=isr_callback)

    global SendState               # To modify a global variable we need to state it's name
    SendState = True
    disable_btirq()
   
    #print('pin change', p)



def timer_callback(t):
    # Register interrup pin
    if not button.value():
        tim.init(period=200, mode=Timer.ONE_SHOT, callback=timer_callback)
        print("Button not released")
    else:
        enable_btirq()
        print("Waiting for you")


# Send the data over the network
def sendData(netData):
    #print("Sending data: ")
    #print(netData)

    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect((HOST, PORT))
    sock.sendall(netData + "\n\n")
    received = sock.recv(1024)
    sock.close()

    #print("Got data echo: ")
    #print(received)





print("Waiting for user input")
# Register interrup pin
enable_btirq()

while True:
     
    if SendState:
        # Clear the new event flag set in the interrupt
        SendState = False
        # Toggle the state of the LED
        LEDState = not LEDState

        
        # We have an event and the interrupt was disabled. Enable the interruptagain with the timer
        # This is our debounce
	tim.init(period=200, mode=Timer.ONE_SHOT, callback=timer_callback)
	# Timer example from https://www.dfrobot.com/blog-606.html


        if LEDState:     # Represents the pushbutton state
            led.off()    # Light up the LED
	    netValue = "on"
        else:
            led.on()     # No light
	    netValue = "off"

	netData = "binary LED8 %s" % (netValue)

	sendData(netData)

```
